# Project Outline

## Title
On the Reliability of Deep Learning Models for Survival Prediction in Healthcare

## Research Question
Are deep learning models for survival prediction reliable enough for clinical decision-making, beyond raw predictive performance?

## Motivation
Deep learning models are increasingly used for survival analysis in healthcare.
However, their calibration and uncertainty are often overlooked, despite critical
implications for medical decision-making.

## Planned Methods
- Cox Proportional Hazards model
- DeepSurv
- Temporal deep learning model (LSTM or Transformer)

## Evaluation
- C-index
- Brier score
- Calibration curves
- Uncertainty analysis

## Dataset
MIMIC-IV (ICU patient data)

## Status
Project initialization
